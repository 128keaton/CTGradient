# CTGradient
Originally from http://svn.oofn.net, CTGradient is extremely similar to Apple's own NSGradient. In fact, it is almost a drop-in replacement. CTGradient, however, predates NSGradient and is compatible down to OS X 10.2.

This fork has been updated to work on 64 bit machines.

All the original code was written by Chad Weider.
